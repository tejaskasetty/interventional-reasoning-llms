<T1>-><T2>|I'm going to describe a causal graphical model. There are two variables: <T1> and <T2>. <T1> causes <T2>. These are all the causal relationships in the graph. An operation we can perform on a variable in a causal directed acyclic graphical model is called '<do>(<variable>=<value>)'. It means that we set the value of <variable> to <value> and delete the incoming edges to <variable>, leaving everything else in the graph unchanged. Suppose we perform the perfect intervention, <do>(<T2>=<vT2>)|In this intervened causal graphical model, is there a directed path going from <T1> to <T2>?|no
