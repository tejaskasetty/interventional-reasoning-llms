<T1>-><T2>-><T3>|I'm going to describe a causal graphical directed acyclic model. There are three variables: <T1>, <T2> and <T3>. <T1> causes <T2>. <T2> causes <T3>.  These are all the causal relationships in the graph. An operation we can perform on a variable in a causal directed acyclic graphical model is called '<do>(<variable>=<value>)'. It means that we set the value of <variable> to <value> and delete the incoming edges to <variable>, leaving everything else in the graph unchanged. Suppose we perform the perfect intervention, <do>(<T1>=<vT1>)|In this intervened causal graphical model, does <T1> cause <T2>?|yes
