<T1>-><T2>-><T3>|I'm going to describe a causal graphical directed acyclic model. There are three variables: <T1>, <T2> and <T3>. <T1> causes <T2>. <T2> causes <T3>.  These are all the causal relationships in the graph. Suppose we perform the perfect intervention, do(<T2>=<vT2>). Then, on this intervened causal model, we perform the perfect intervention, do(<T1> = <vT1>)|In this final intervened causal graphical model, is there a directed path going from <T1> to <T3>?|no
