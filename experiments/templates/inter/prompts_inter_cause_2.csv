<T1>-><T2>-><T3>|I'm going to describe a causal graphical directed acyclic model. There are three variables: <T1>, <T2> and <T3>. <T1> causes <T2>. <T2> causes <T3>.  These are all the causal relationships in the graph. Suppose we perform the perfect intervention, do(<T1>=<vT1>)|In this intervened causal graphical model, does <T1> cause <T2>?|yes
