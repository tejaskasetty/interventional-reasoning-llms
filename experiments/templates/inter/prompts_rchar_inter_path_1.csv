<T1><-<T3>-><T2>|I'm going to describe a causal graphical directed acyclic model. There are three variables: <T1>, <T2> and <T3>. <T3> causes <T1>. <T3> causes <T2>.  These are all the causal relationships in the graph. Suppose we perform the perfect intervention, do(<T1>=<vT1>)|In this intervened causal graphical model, is there a directed path going from <T1> to <T2>?|no
